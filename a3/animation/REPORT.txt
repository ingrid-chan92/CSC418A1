Work Distribution:
- Ingrid
	- Skybox
	- Trees/Terrain
	- Created snowballs (for avalanche in animated scene)
- Karin
	- Snow particle effect
	- Character Model/Sled Model
	- Animated the scene


COMPONENTS:
Animation:
--------------------------------
- Animation will be done via Keyframing. Code adapted from A2.
- We decided to code the animation on Linux for easier portability between us. Unfortunately, as we are both running on VMs, the fps is low and the video rendered is slightly choppy.
- Animation video can be found at: https://youtu.be/k4qq73Ni0xQ


Snow Effect:
--------------------------------
- Snow is implemented in particle.h and particle.cpp
- Calls to make the snow work in "main.cpp" can be found by finding on "snow"
	- Snow is set in "initDS" 
	- Initializing of the snow called in "main"
	- Clearing of the snow called in "animateButton"
	- Reviving/Updating/Rendering snow called in "display"
	
- Used the SOIL library to read the texture. Src files used to reduce space

Skybox:
--------------------------------
- Skybox is implemented in main.cpp with utility found in Util.cpp. It is a cube with inward-facing sides surrounding the scene.
- Util.cpp is borrowed directly from Skybox Documentation below
- Relevant methods: drawSkybox(), initDS()

Terrain:
--------------------------------
- Terrain is implemented in Terrain.cpp. InitTerrain() will grab all initial starting points for the vertices and the texture to be used for rendering and is called in Main(). RenderTerrain() will draw the terrain onto the scene

Trees:
--------------------------------
- Trees are made from three cones: One for the trunk, two for the branches. Trees are then generated via for loop in a 100 x 100 grid with set offset
